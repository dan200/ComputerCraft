Contributing
============

While ComputerCraft will no longer be actively developed by Daniel Ratcliffe, you may still contribute pull requests which will be reviewed and incorporated into releases periodically. A pull request is more likely to be accepted if it meets the following criteria:

* It does not add any new dependencies for compiling, running or using the mod.
* It does not break compatibility with world saves or programs created with previous versions of the mod.
* It does not add unnecessary complexity for users of the mod, and maintains the accessibility for which the mod is known.
* It does not add unnecessary complexity or stylistic changes to the code, especially where functionality is not being changed.
* It does not create bugs!

The pull requests most likely to be accepted are those which fix bugs, simplify code, or make the mod compatible with newer versions of Minecraft.
