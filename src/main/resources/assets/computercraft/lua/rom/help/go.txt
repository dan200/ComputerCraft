go is a program for Turtles, used to control the turtle without programming. It accepts one or more commands as a direction followed by a distance.

ex:
"go forward" moves the turtle 1 space forward.
"go forward 3" moves the turtle 3 spaces forward.
"go forward 3 up left 2" moves the turtle 3 spaces forward, 1 spaces up, then left 180 degrees.
