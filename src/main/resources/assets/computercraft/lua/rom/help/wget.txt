wget is a program for downloading files from the internet. This is useful for downloading programs created by other players.
If no filename is specified wget will try to determine the filename from the URL by stripping any anchors, parameters and trailing slashes and then taking everything remaining after the last slash.
The HTTP API must be enabled in ComputerCraft.cfg to use this program.
ex:
"wget http://pastebin.com/raw/CxaWmPrX test" will download the file from the URL http://pastebin.com/raw/CxaWmPrX, and save it as "test".
"wget http://example.org/test.lua/?foo=bar#qzu" will download the file from the URL http://example.org/test.lua/?foo=bar#qzu and save it as "test.lua"
"wget http://example.org/" will download the file from the URL http://example.org and save it as "example.org"
