pocket is an API available on pocket computers, which allows modifying its upgrades.
Functions in the pocket API:
pocket.equipBack()
pocket.unequipBack()
pocket.beep( [nVolume] , [nPitch] )

When equipping upgrades, it will search your inventory for a suitable upgrade, starting in the selected slot. If one cannot be found then it will check your offhand.
When using beep, the build in speaker is limited to only one beep per ingame tick. Works similiary to speaker peripheral except nPitch accepts only numbers from 0-5 and plays only 6 tones instead of 25 allowed by speaker.
