ComputerCraft是一个为我的世界添加了可编程的机器和电脑的模组。如果对ComputerCraft不太熟悉，可以访问[这里](http://www.computercraft.info/download)或者访问我们的 [Wiki](http://www.computercraft.info/wiki)去查看更多信息。

关于这个仓库
=====================

ComputerCraft最开始在2011末由[Daniel Ratcliffe](https://twitter.com/DanTwoHundred)发布，在2017年的早些时候，在单独开发了这个mod五年之后，我们打算公开发布源代码来允许Dan有更多的时间来关注其它的项目，这个仓库就是我们发布第一个公开源代码的地方。

The code in this repository will always represent the "bleeding edge" of the ComputerCraft codebase, but stable builds back to 1.79 will be marked on the [Releases](https://github.com/dan200/ComputerCraft/releases) page.

贡献
============

While ComputerCraft will no longer be actively developed by Daniel Ratcliffe, you may still contribute pull requests which will be reviewed and incorporated into releases periodically. A pull request is more likely to be accepted if it meets the following criteria:

* It does not add any new dependencies for compiling, running or using the mod.
* It does not break compatibility with world saves or programs created with previous versions of the mod.
* It does not add unneccessary complexity for users of the mod, and maintains the accessibility for which the mod is known.
* It does not add unneccessary complexity or stylistic changes to the code, especially where functionality is not being changed.
* It does not create bugs!

The pull requests most likely to be accepted are those which fix bugs, simplify code, or make the mod compatible with newer versions of Minecraft.
