About this Repository
=====================

ComputerCraft was originally released in late 2011 by [Daniel Ratcliffe](https://twitter.com/DanTwoHundred). In early 2017, after working on the mod solo for five years, it was decided to release the source code publicly to allow Dan to devote time to other projects. This repository marks the first public release of this source code.

The code in this repository will always represent the "bleeding edge" of the ComputerCraft codebase, but stable builds back to 1.79 will be marked on the [Releases](https://github.com/dan200/ComputerCraft/releases) page.
